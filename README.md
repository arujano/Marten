</div>

Merten is a networking framework for [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (C#/dotnet) built on top of [Nakama](https://heroiclabs.com/nakama/).

## Installation

Currently, installing marten is composed of three steps.

1. Install the `NakamaClient` (version `3.12.x`) dotnet plugin. 
1. Install the `Newtonsoft.Json` (version `13.x`) dotnet plugin. 
3. Clone this repository anywhere inside your Godot project's folder.

## Legal notes

Marten is currently being made as a hobby project and, as such, **will not be held accountable for the security of software made using it**. Currently, it only supports client-relayed multiplayer, which is not recommended for competitive games.
